# Teams Keeper

Chrome extension to keep your Microsoft Teams session active (not hosted on the Chrome Web Store).

---

## Install (you or a friend)

Chrome only allows installing extensions from the Chrome Web Store when you use a .crx file — so for this extension you have to use **Load unpacked** and keep the folder.

1. **Download** the extension: [download ZIP](https://github.com/ramithks/teams-keeper) from GitHub (or clone the repo) and unzip.
2. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `teams-keeper` folder (the one that contains `manifest.json`).
4. **Keep the folder** — Chrome runs the extension from it. You can put it in Documents or somewhere out of the way.
5. Open Teams in your browser and use the extension icon to turn it on.

## Sending to a friend

- Send them the GitHub link: https://github.com/ramithks/teams-keeper — they download the ZIP, unzip, then follow the steps above.
- Or zip the `teams-keeper` folder yourself and send the zip; they unzip it and use **Load unpacked** on that folder.

**Want no folder at all?** The only way is to publish the extension on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole) (one-time $5 developer account). Then anyone can install with one click.
